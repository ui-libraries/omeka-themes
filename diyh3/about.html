                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>
                  DIY History lets you do it yourself to help make historic artifacts easier to use. Our digital
                  library holds hundreds of thousands of items—much more than library staff could ever
                  catalog alone, so we're appealing to the public to help out by attaching text in the form of
                  transcriptions, tags, and comments. Through "crowdsourcing," or engaging volunteers to
                  contribute effort toward large-scale goals, these mass quantities of digitized artifacts
                  become searchable, allowing researchers to quickly seek out specific information, and
                  general users to browse and enjoy the materials more easily. Please join us in preserving
                  our past by keeping the historic record accessible—one page or picture at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>The Collections</h2>
                <p>
                  Content on DIY History is drawn from the Iowa Digital Library, featuring digitized
                  selections from the University of Iowa Libraries' Special Collections, University Archives,
                  and Iowa Women's Archives. DIY History will continuously be updated with additional
                  content, so check back! If you would like to suggest items for inclusion from the UI's
                  holdings, please contact us.
                </p>
                <h2>What software powers the site?</h2>
                <p>
                  DIY History is powered by Omeka 2, with a custom theme and transcription plugin
                  developed by The Digital Scholarship & Publishing Studio at the University of Iowa
                  Libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>How did this project start?</h2>
                <p>
                  The University of Iowa Libraries began its first experiment in crowdsourcing with the Civil
                  War Diaries and Letters Transcription Project. From the site’s debut in the spring of 2011
                  to commemorate the Civil War sesquicentennial, through the fall of 2012, volunteer
                  contributors transcribed over 15,000 pages. With the diaries and letters nearly completed,
                  the project was expanded to include transcription opportunities for handwritten materials
                  outside of the Civil War collections; DIY History, which also features commenting and
                  tagging functionality for our historic photograph collections, was launched in October
                  2012.
                </p>
                <h2>What is the goal of this project?</h2>
                <p>
                  The goal of DIY History is to make historic artifacts more accessible – both by enhancing
                  catalog records for greater ease in searching and browsing, and by engaging the public to
                  interact with the materials in new ways. While typeset texts can be scanned with OCR
                  (optical character recognition) technology to quickly and inexpensively add full text
                  searchability, there’s no such easy fix for other primary source materials like handwritten
                  documents or photographs. Making these items findable requires time-consuming manual
                  labor to transcribe or describe each item – a process that doesn’t scale with traditional
                  library workflows. By outsourcing this work to volunteers and attaching their
                  contributions to the artifacts in our digital library, users can search on this added text to
                  more quickly and easily find what they’re seeking. With DIY History, we’re also hoping to
                  attract new users interested in more active engagement with the collections. By
                  volunteering their time to help make these materials more accessible, participants can
                  learn new information about past eras while assisting others, including researchers using
                  the documents, as well as the original authors and photographers whose stories they're
                  helping to preserve.
